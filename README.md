# Adventures in Compilation

Instead of trying to "implement a cool programming language", a project that I have started maybe a dozen times and never got far with, the idea here is to play with different algorithms of compilation on extremely simplistic languages.

## Adventure 7: implement while-loops

- [x] Implement conversion through IRs that I have
- [x] Fix liveness analysis to use search for fixed point
- [x] Debug the output of compilation of sum5.lvar (the partial evaluator is not correct)
- [x] Fix partial evaluation

## Adventure 6: convert LVar to LIf following chapter 5 of Essentials of Compilation

- [x] Implement postfix conditional in the parser
- [x] Add new operators and fix up the partial evaluator
- [x] Figure out why partial evaluation seems to be getting stuck on new test (turned out to be RCO pass, which gets in an infinite loop due to wrong assumptions)
- [x] Add conditional statements to the AST and parse them
- [x] Improve printing of parse errors
- [x] Fix the issue with parsing of conditional statements
- [x] Write type checker for the source language
- [x] Connect the type checker to the compiler
- [x] Implement shrinking pass that gets rid of `and` and `or` binary operators
- [x] Extend RCO pass to the new language features, adding necessary constructors to the IR
- [x] Write AST definitions for new C-like intermediate language
- [x] Implement "explicate control" pass
- [x] Implement human-readable printing of C-like IR
- [x] Implement human-readable printing of monadic IR as well
- [x] Check that explicate control works similarly to the book (it's not, but it's close enough. Not sure how to make it match though)
- [x] Add new X86 constructs to its abstract syntax
- [x] Implement printing those new X86 constructs into concrete syntax used by GCC
- [x] Create a module for directed graphs
- [x] Convert C-like IR module to a directed graph of jumps needed for liveness analysis
- [x] Implement topological sorting for arbitrary graphs
- [x] Print the topological sorting of blocks in C-like IR
- [x] Implement liveness analysis for acyclic CFG
- [x] Change the computation of interference graph to use the full liveness information
- [x] Write the code to perform location replacement on graph of blocks
- [x] Change the output assembly generation to include labels as well
- [x] Test the changes to see if the compiled code actually works
- [x] Change the code so that conclusion is generated with additional label
- [x] Make the partial evaluation work for conditional expressions
- [x] Finish peCmp function
- [x] Remove CmpLit constructor
- [x] Figure out why one of the tests does not compile successfully (some locations do not show up in the interference graph)
- [x] Write a function to print X86 code with names in them, together with liveness information.
- [x] There seems to be a mess in the X86-with-variables output that immediates are printed in the same way as variables. Fix it.
- [x] Collect all locations present in the program to compute the coloring instead of relying on those present in interference graph
- [x] Remove `traceShow` from Compiler.hs
- [x] Refactor patchInstruction to reduce the amount of boilerplate, also add support for `xorq` and maybe `cmpq` instrctions (find out if that's really necessary first)
- [x] Clean up the current mess that is the current executable: there should be only one flow through the compilation passes, that might emit additional files in the process
- [x] Implement the basic blocks optimization before register allocation
- [x] Omit "conclusion" label from the suffix of the program if there is only one basic block
- [x] Implement pretty-printing of typechecker error and use it in the compiler pipeline

## Adventure 5: back to actual compilation; implement register allocation for LVar

- [x] Restart reading text from chapter 4 and find the code that I've already implemented for it
- [x] Implement building an interference graph

- [x] Preserve callee-saved registers on the stack
- [x] Write a script to recompile all the test cases and commit changes to assembly code, to more easily see how the changes in the compiler affect the resulting code

## Bucket list

- Refactor regular expression compilation code: especially subset construction and DFA minimization are quite messy

## Useful CLI incantations

Using profiling from Cabal:

```
cabal run --enable-profiling lvar -- tests/cond.lvar +RTS -p
```

## Things I've learned while working on this

### Megaparsec expression parsing

Ordering of the parsers in the table for operators matters: if at the same level of precedence I flip parser for `<=` and `<`, parsing of `<=` stops working. Presumably, because the tokens are overlapping. It does not look like there are any diagnostic information available to show me that I'm doing something potentially incorrect (and that's why I actually prefer proper parser generators that have more knowledge about the domain and are able to display those kinds of diagnostics by the way).

### Don't think that typeclass instances do the "obvious thing that I want"

For example, `Monoid` instance for `Data.Map` seems to be just "take the first element", instead of combining the values via monoidal operation (as I've expected).
