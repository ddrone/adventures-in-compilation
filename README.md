# Adventures in Compilation

Instead of trying to "implement a cool programming language", a project that I have started maybe a dozen times and never got far with, the idea here is to play with different algorithms of compilation on extremely simplistic languages.

## Adventure 1: simple SSA construction

- [x] Implement compilation of statements into CFG blocks
- [x] Implement compilation of functions into CFG blocks
- [ ] Print out the CFG in some human-readable format
- [ ] Add conditionals to the language
- [ ] Implement conversion of CFG to SSA-form, adding phi-nodes
- [ ] Implement code generation to x86-64 assembly
- [ ] Only then add while-loops to the language

## Adventure 2: graph algorithms for SSA construction

- [x] Finding dominators in directed graph
- [ ] Building domination tree
- [ ] Computing domination frontier
